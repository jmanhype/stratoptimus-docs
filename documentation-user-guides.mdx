## Configuration

Proper configuration is vital for tailoring the **StratOptimus-TradingWizard** to specific needs and optimizing its performance. This section outlines the essential configuration parameters and how to adjust them.

### Key Configuration Parameters

- **Initial Parameters**: Define the starting point for trading strategy optimization.
  
  ```json
  {
    "take_profit": 0.08,
    "stop_loss": 0.12,
    "sl_window": 400,
    "max_orders": 3,
    "post_buy_delay": 2,
    "post_sell_delay": 5,
    "macd_signal_fast": 120,
    "macd_signal_slow": 260,
    "macd_signal_signal": 90,
    "min_macd_signal_threshold": 0.0,
    "max_macd_signal_threshold": 0.0,
    "enable_sl_mod": false,
    "enable_tp_mod": false,
    "fees": 0.001
  }
  ```

  - **take_profit**: The percentage at which to take profit.
  - **stop_loss**: The percentage at which to stop loss.
  - **sl_window**: The window size for stop loss calculations.
  - **max_orders**: Maximum number of concurrent orders.
  - **post_buy_delay**: Delay after a buy order.
  - **post_sell_delay**: Delay after a sell order.
  - **macd_signal_fast**: Fast period for MACD signal.
  - **macd_signal_slow**: Slow period for MACD signal.
  - **macd_signal_signal**: Signal period for MACD.
  - **min_macd_signal_threshold**: Minimum threshold for MACD signal.
  - **max_macd_signal_threshold**: Maximum threshold for MACD signal.
  - **enable_sl_mod**: Enable modification of stop loss.
  - **enable_tp_mod**: Enable modification of take profit.
  - **fees**: Trading fees as a percentage.

### Updating Configuration

To update the configuration:

1. Locate the `trading_config.yaml` file in the `config` directory.
2. Modify the parameters as needed based on your optimization goals.
3. Ensure that all required parameters are set to avoid runtime errors.

## Example Usage

Providing examples in the documentation allows users to see practical applications of the project's features, facilitating better understanding and adoption.

### Simple Usage Example

Consider this basic example of how to execute a predefined workflow:

```bash
python -m workflows.run_workflow --name initial_strategy_development
```

### Running Optimization

To perform trading strategy optimization, use the `run_optimization.py` script. Ensure that the configuration file is correctly set up with all necessary parameters.

```bash
python Trading/run_optimization.py
```

**Example Command:**

```bash
python Trading/run_optimization.py
```

This command will:

1. Load the trading configuration from `config/trading_config.yaml`.
2. Initialize the LLM instance using the specified configuration.
3. Load trading data from the specified pickle file.
4. Execute recursive optimization using the initial parameters.
5. Save the best trading strategy to the designated output directory.

For more detailed explanations of each parameter and additional usage scenarios, please refer to the [Configuration](/configuration) section.

## Diagrammatic Representations

Visual aids like diagrams can significantly enhance comprehension. Use **mermaid diagrams** to visually represent workflows and processes within the project.
