# StratOptimus: Automating Agentic Workflow Generation in StratOptimus

## Introduction

StratOptimus is a cutting-edge framework integrated into the StratOptimus-TradingWizard project, designed to automate the generation and optimization of agentic workflows using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). By leveraging StratOptimus, StratOptimus enhances its ability to develop, refine, and optimize trading strategies with minimal human intervention, ensuring scalability, adaptability, and superior performance across diverse trading scenarios.

## Problem Statement

Constructing effective agentic workflows traditionally requires significant manual effort, limiting scalability and adaptability. StratOptimus addresses these challenges by automating the discovery and optimization of workflows, enabling StratOptimus to efficiently navigate the vast search space of possible workflow configurations. This automation not only accelerates the development process but also ensures that the workflows are optimized for performance and cost-effectiveness.

### Challenges in Workflow Optimization

1. **Manual Setup Requirement:** Existing methods often necessitate an initial manual setup, hindering full automation.
2. **Limited Search Efficiency:** Traditional optimization techniques struggle to efficiently explore the extensive search space of workflow configurations.
3. **Representation Constraints:** Previous approaches fail to capture the diversity and complexity required for a wide range of tasks, limiting their utility across different domains.

## StratOptimus Framework

StratOptimus revolutionizes workflow optimization by modeling workflows as graph structures composed of LLM-invoking nodes connected by edges. This representation allows StratOptimus to explore a vast search space effectively, discovering workflows that maximize task performance while minimizing human effort.

### Key Components

1. **Nodes and Edges:**
   - **Nodes:** Represent specific LLM actions, characterized by parameters such as the model used, prompts, temperature settings, and output formats.
   - **Edges:** Define the logical flow, dependencies, and transitions between nodes, enabling the construction of complex, hierarchical, or parallel workflows.

2. **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS):**
   - **Selection:** Chooses workflows based on a soft mixed probability strategy that balances exploration and exploitation.
   - **Expansion:** Utilizes LLMs to generate new workflow configurations by modifying existing nodes and edges.
   - **Evaluation:** Executes workflows to assess their performance against defined evaluation metrics.
   - **Backpropagation:** Updates the search tree with performance feedback to inform future selections.

3. **Operators:**
   - Predefined, reusable combinations of nodes that encapsulate common agentic operations (e.g., Ensemble, Review, Revise). Operators serve as building blocks, streamlining the workflow generation process and enhancing search efficiency.

### Workflow Representation

Workflows in StratOptimus are represented as code structures, allowing for precise control over workflow execution. This code-based representation supports various structures, including:

- **Sequential:** Linear progression of tasks.
- **Conditional:** Branching based on specific conditions or criteria.
- **Parallel:** Concurrent execution of independent tasks.

This flexibility ensures that StratOptimus can model complex trading strategies that adapt to varying market conditions and data inputs.

## Integration with StratOptimus

StratOptimus is seamlessly integrated into the StratOptimus-TradingWizard project, particularly within the `Trading/workflows/round_1/graph.py` file. This integration facilitates the automated optimization of trading strategies through a structured and efficient workflow.

Output the modified graph and all the necessary Prompts in prompt_custom (if needed).
The prompt you need to generate is only the one used in `prompt_custom.XXX` within Custom. Other methods already have built-in prompts and are prohibited from being generated. Only generate those needed for use in `prompt_custom`; please remove any unused prompts in prompt_custom.

## How StratOptimus Works in StratOptimus

StratOptimus operates by iteratively refining the workflow used for trading strategy optimization. It employs a search algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore various workflow configurations, selecting and modifying them to enhance performance metrics such as total return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown.

### Workflow Execution Flow

1. **Initialization:**
   - StratOptimus starts with a basic workflow template defined in `graph.py`.
   - It uses predefined operators and prompts to set up the initial workflow structure.

2. **Selection:**
   - Using a soft mixed probability selection strategy, StratOptimus chooses workflows to explore further based on past performance and exploration criteria.

3. **Expansion:**
   - StratOptimus leverages LLMs to generate new workflow configurations by modifying existing nodes and edges, guided by the optimization prompts defined in `optimize_prompt.py`.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - The newly generated workflows are executed, and their performance is assessed using metrics like total return and Sharpe ratio.
   - Results are logged for further analysis and refinement.

5. **Backpropagation:**
   - Performance feedback is used to update the search tree, informing future selections and modifications to workflows.

6. **Termination:**
   - The process continues until the maximum number of iterations is reached or convergence criteria are met, ensuring that an optimal workflow is achieved.
