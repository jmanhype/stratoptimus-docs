# JAX Best Practices

JAX is a powerful library for high-performance numerical computations in Python, offering facilities for automatic differentiation and just-in-time (JIT) compilation. In the context of the **StratOptimus-TradingWizard** project, utilizing JAX efficiently is essential for developing robust and scalable trading algorithms. Here, we explore some best practices to ensure optimal use of JAX capabilities.

## Functional API Usage

JAX promotes the use of a functional programming style, which enhances code readability and maintainability.

- **Statelessness and Immutability:** Functions should be pure, meaning they depend only on their inputs and have no side effects, such as modifying global variables or in-place mutations.
  
Example:
```python
import jax.numpy as jnp
import jax

def relu(x):
    return jnp.maximum(0, x)

grad_relu = jax.grad(lambda x: jnp.sum(relu(x)))
```

## Automatic Differentiation

JAX's automatic differentiation is a core feature that allows gradient computation with ease.

- **Using `jax.grad`:** This function is ideal for obtaining the gradient of scalar-valued functions.

- **`jax.value_and_grad`:** Use this when you need both the value of the function and its gradient.

### Example:

```python
def loss(weights, inputs):
    return jnp.sum(weights * inputs ** 2)

weights = jnp.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
inputs = jnp.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3])
loss_value, grad_loss = jax.value_and_grad(loss)(weights, inputs)
```

<Callout> If your function returns an array, use `jax.jacobian` for differentiation instead of `jax.grad`. </Callout>

## Just-In-Time Compilation (JIT)

JIT compilation is a powerful tool in JAX that can drastically enhance performance. Here's how to leverage it effectively:

- **Identify Hotspots:** Focus on computationally intensive functions that are called repeatedly. These are prime candidates for JIT compilation.
  
- **Avoid Python Control Structures:** Ensure that the functions you plan to JIT compile use JAX's control flow operations instead of Python's native loops or conditionals.

### Example:

```python
@jax.jit
def compute(inputs):
    return jnp.dot(inputs, inputs.T)

result = compute(jnp.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]]))
```

## Vectorization with `vmap`

The `jax.vmap` function allows you to vectorize your operations, taking advantage of parallel computations without explicit loops.

### Example:
```python
def compute_square(x):
    return x ** 2

vectorized_square = jax.vmap(compute_square)
result = vectorized_square(jnp.array([1, 2, 3, 4]))
```

<Callout> Prefer `vmap` over manual looping to ensure consistency across all vectorized operations. <</Callout>

## Managing Randomness

JAX has a unique approach to randomness, employing a functional pseudo-random number generator (PRNG).

- **Use PRNG keys:** Always pass PRNG keys explicitly to functions requiring randomness to maintain reproducibility.

- **Split Keys:** Generate new keys using `jax.random.split`.

### Example:
```python
import jax.random as random

key = random.PRNGKey(0)
key, subkey = random.split(key)
random_numbers = random.uniform(subkey, (5,))
```

## JAX Control Flow

JAX provides its own control flow operations for loops and conditionals, ensuring compatibility with JIT compilation.

- **Use `jax.lax.scan` for loops** and `jax.lax.cond` for conditional statements.

### Example of a simple loop:
```python
def loop_body(carry, x):
    return carry + x, carry + x

result, _ = jax.lax.scan(loop_body, 0, jnp.arange(5))
```
