# Code Style and Structure

A well-defined code style and structure are crucial for the maintainability and readability of any software project. In the **StratOptimus-TradingWizard** project, we adhere to industry-standard best practices to ensure consistent and efficient code. This section outlines these practices and offers guidance on how they are implemented within the project.

## PEP 8 Compliance

We strictly follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) guidelines, the official style guide for Python code. This helps maintain consistency across the codebase and improves readability. Key aspects of PEP 8 compliance include:

- **Indentation:** Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
- **Maximum Line Length:** Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
- **Imports:** Place imports at the top of the file, grouped into three categories, each separated by a blank line:
  - Standard library imports
  - Related third-party imports
  - Local application/library specific imports

<Callout>
It's recommended to use tools like `flake8` or `pylint` to automatically check your code for PEP 8 compliance.
</Callout>

### Avoiding Duplicate Imports and Path Insertions

Duplicate imports and redundant path insertions can lead to confusion and potential errors. Ensure that each module or package is imported only once and that the `sys.path` is modified minimally and intentionally.

- **Single Path Insertion:** Avoid inserting the same path multiple times into `sys.path`.
- **No Redundant Imports:** Ensure that each import statement is unique and necessary. Remove any duplicate imports to maintain clarity.

## Modular Design

Adopting a modular design approach allows us to break the codebase into smaller, manageable, and reusable components. Each module in the project encapsulates specific functionality, promoting separation of concerns and ease of debugging.

- **Functionality Separation:** Group related functions into modules or classes that perform a cohesive set of tasks.
- **Code Reusability:** Write generic functions and modules that can be reused across the project. Avoiding duplicate code reduces maintenance efforts.

### Example Structure

Here's an example of how modules are structured in the project:

```plain text
best_trading_strategy/
├── actions/
│   ├── project_management.py
│   ├── write_code.py
│   └── research.py
├── workflows/
│   ├── round_1/
│   └── template/
├── prompts/
└── src/
```

## Descriptive Naming

Naming conventions play a crucial role in conveying the intent of code components. In our project, we ensure that names are descriptive and self-explanatory.

- **Variables and Functions:** Use clear and descriptive names like `learning_rate`, `optimize_parameters`, and `fetch_market_data`.
- **Consistency:** Stick to a single naming convention throughout the project, such as using `snake_case` for variables and functions.

<Steps>

### Step 1

When defining a variable to store user inputs, use a name that reflects its purpose, like `user_input`.

### Step 2

For functions, use action-oriented names. For example, a function that processes trading data should be named `process_trading_data`.

</Steps>

## Proper Configuration Management

Effective management of configurations is essential for maintaining flexibility and scalability in the project.

- **Environment Variables:** Utilize environment variables for sensitive information and configuration settings. Use libraries like `dotenv` to manage these variables.
- **Configuration Files:** Organize configuration settings in structured files (e.g., YAML, JSON) and load them appropriately within the codebase.

### Example

```python
# Load environment variables from .env file
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

# Load configuration
from scripts.config_utils import load_config
config = load_config(os.environ.get("TRADING_CONFIG_PATH", "config/trading_config.yaml"))
```

## Logging Best Practices

Proper logging is vital for monitoring, debugging, and maintaining the application.

- **Consistent Logging Configuration:** Set up logging configurations at the entry point of the application to ensure consistency across all modules.
- **Appropriate Log Levels:** Use appropriate log levels (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`) to categorize log messages.
- **Log Handlers:** Direct logs to multiple destinations (e.g., files, stdout) as needed.

### Example

```python
import logging
import sys

# Set up logging configuration
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,  # Set to DEBUG to capture all levels of logs
    format="%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s",
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler("workflow_errors.log"),
        logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)
    ]
)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

## Avoiding In-Place Mutations

To maintain code clarity and avoid potential side effects, we emphasize the use of immutable data structures.

- **Immutable Types:** Prefer immutable data types like tuples over lists unless mutation is necessary.
- **Function Outputs:** Functions should return new objects instead of modifying the input parameters.

## Preferred Programming Paradigms

While the project is built using Python, following functional programming principles can increase code clarity and ease of testing.

- **Pure Functions:** Implement functions that do not produce side effects and whose output solely depends on their inputs.
- **Higher-Order Functions:** Utilize higher-order functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them.

## Error Handling and Validation

Robust error handling and input validation are crucial for building reliable applications.

- **Input Validation:** Always validate input shapes and data types before performing computations.
- **Exception Handling:** Use try-except blocks to handle potential exceptions gracefully and provide informative error messages.
- **Logging Errors:** Log errors with sufficient context to facilitate debugging.

### Example

```python
try:
    # Some operation
    result = perform_operation(data)
except ValueError as ve:
    logger.error(f"ValueError encountered: {ve}")
    raise
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}", exc_info=True)
    raise
```

## Example Code

Here is an example of a well-styled function in the project:

```python
def calculate_sharpe_ratio(returns, risk_free_rate):
    """Calculate the Sharpe ratio for a given set of returns.

    Args:
        returns (array-like): The returns of the investment.
        risk_free_rate (float): The risk-free rate of return.

    Returns:
        float: The Sharpe ratio.
    """
    excess_returns = [r - risk_free_rate for r in returns]
    mean_excess_return = np.mean(excess_returns)
    stddev_excess_return = np.std(excess_returns)
    return mean_excess_return / stddev_excess_return
```

This function is concise, well-documented, and adheres to all discussed coding standards.

## Updated Practices Based on Recent Code Changes

### Avoiding Duplicate Imports and Path Insertions

Recent updates in the codebase have highlighted the importance of eliminating duplicate import statements and redundant path insertions. Ensure that:

- **Each module or package is imported only once.**
- **`sys.path.insert()` is used minimally and without duplication.**

### Proper Configuration and Parameter Handling

With the addition of new parameters such as `ma_window` and `fees` in configuration files, it's essential to:

- **Include default values with type hints in configuration classes (e.g., Pydantic models).**
- **Ensure all configuration parameters are loaded and validated appropriately.**

### Enhanced Logging Configuration

Recent scripts have incorporated more detailed logging configurations to capture essential debugging information. Best practices include:

- **Setting appropriate log levels (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, etc.) based on the environment (development, production).**
- **Directing logs to both files and standard output for comprehensive monitoring.**

### Functional Programming and Asynchronous Patterns

The introduction of asynchronous functions and recursive optimization workflows emphasizes the need to:

- **Adopt asynchronous programming patterns where appropriate to enhance performance.**
- **Ensure functions are pure and free of side effects to maintain compatibility with JIT compilation and other optimizations.**

### Example of Updated Best Practices in Code

```python

        })
        
        # Load trading data
        trading_data = load_trade_data("big_optimize_1016.pkl")

        if trading_data is None:
            logger.error("Failed to load trading data. Please ensure the pickle file exists and is accessible.")
            return

        # Create a dataset with a subset of assets for optimization
        dataset = list(trading_data.keys())[:5]  # Use the first 5 assets for example
        
        # Run recursive optimization
        best_strategy, best_performance = await recursive_optimization(
            initial_params=initial_params,
            dataset=dataset,
            llm=llm,
            trading_data=trading_data,
            max_iterations=config.get("max_rounds", 45),
            convergence_threshold=config.get("convergence_threshold", 0.01),
            parallel_evaluations=config.get("parallel_evaluations", 5)
        )

        # Save the best strategy
        if best_strategy:
            with open(os.path.join(output_dir, "best_trading_strategy_final.json"), "w") as f:
                json.dump(best_strategy, f, indent=2)
            logger.info(f"Optimization completed. Best strategy saved to {output_dir}")
            logger.info(f"Best performance: {best_performance}")
        else:
            logger.error("Optimization failed.")

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

This updated script follows best practices by eliminating duplicate imports and path insertions, configuring logging appropriately, and managing configurations effectively.
